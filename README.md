## (Original Documentation) Welcome to SlickGrid

**UPDATE From Mr. Leibman:  March 5th, 2014 - I have too many things going on in my life right now to really give SlickGrid support and development the time and attention it deserves.  I am not stopping it, but I will most likely be unresponsive for some time.  Sorry.**

Find documentation and examples in [the wiki](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki).
